**Quantum computing** is a model of computing based on the quantum physics, which works differently than classical computers and can do things that classical computers can‚Äôt, such  
as breaking RSA and ECC efficiently. **Quantum computers** are not "faster computers" and they are not all-powerful and cannot do any computing job faster. Quantum computers are very efficient for certain problems and quite weak for others.

It is well known in computer science that **quantum computers will break some cryptographic algorithms**, especially the public-key cryptosystems like **RSA**, **ECC** and **ECDSA** that rely on the **IFP** \(integer factorization problem\), the **DLP** \(discrete logarithms problem\) and the **ECDLP** \(elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem\). Quantum algorithms will not be the end of cryptography, because:

* Only some cryptosystems are **quantum-unsafe** \(like RSA, DHKE, ECC, ECDSA and ECDH\).
* Some cryptosystems are **quantum-safe** and will be only slightly affected \(like cryptographic hashes, MAC algorithms and symmetric key ciphers\).

Let's discuss this in details.

## Quantum-Safe and Quantum-Broken Crypto Algorithms

Most cryptographic **hashes** \(like SHA2, SHA3, BLAKE2\), **MAC** algorithms \(like HMAC and CMAK\), **key-derivation functions** \(bcrypt, Scrypt, Argon2\) are basically **quantum-safe** \(only slightly affected by quantum computing\).

* Use 384-bits or more to be quantum-safe \(256-bits should be enough for long time\)

**Symmetric ciphers** \(like AES-256, Twofish-256\) are **quantum-safe**.

* Use 256-bits or more as key length \(don't use 128-bit AES\)

Most popular **public-key cryptosystems** \(like RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, DHKE, ECDH, ElGamal\) are **quantum-broken**!

* Most **digital signature** algorithms \(like RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA\) are **quantum-broken**!
* **Quantum-safe signature** algorithms and public-key cryptosystems are already developed \(e.g. lattice-based or hash-based signatures\), but are not massively used, because of longer keys and longer signatures than ECC.

### ECC Cryptography and Most Digital Signatures are Quantum-Broken!

...

A **k**-bit number can be factored in time of order **O\(k^3\)** using a quantum computer of **5k+1 qubits** \(using Shor's algorithm\).

* See [http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/pubs/preskill-1996-networks.pdf](http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/pubs/preskill-1996-networks.pdf)

256-bit number \(e.g. Bitcoin public key\) can be factorized using 1281 qubits in 72\*256^3 quantum operations.

* ~ 1.2 billion operations == ~ less than 1 second using good machine

ECDSA, DSA, RSA, ElGamal, DHKE, ECDH cryptosystems are all quantum-broken

Conclusion: publishing the signed transactions \(like Ethereum does\) is not quantum safe -&gt; avoid revealing the ECC public key

### Hashes are Quantum Safe

Cryptographic **hashes** \(like SHA2, SHA3, BLAKE2\) are considered **quantum-safe**:

* On traditional computer, finding a collision for 256-bit hash takes ‚àö2^256 steps \(using the [**birthday attack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack)\) -&gt; SHA256 has 2^128 crypto-strength
* Quantum computers might find hash collisions in ‚àõ2^256 operations \(see [the BHT algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9705002.pdf)\), but this is disputed \(see \[Bernstein 2009\] - [http://cr.yp.to/hash/collisioncost-20090823.pdf](http://cr.yp.to/hash/collisioncost-20090823.pdf)
* On theory it might take 2^85 quantum operations to find SHA256 / SHA3-256 collision, but in practice it may cost significantly more. 

Conclusion: SHA256 / SHA3-256 are most probably quantum-safe

* SHA384, SHA512 and SHA3-384, SHA3-512 are quantum-safe

...

### Symmetric Ciphers are Quantum Safe

...

Most symmetric ciphers \(like AES and ChaCha20\) are quantum-safe:

* Quantum era will **double the key size** of the symmetric ciphers, see [http://cr.yp.to/codes/grovercode-20100303.pdf](http://cr.yp.to/codes/grovercode-20100303.pdf%29%29\)

AES-256 in the post-quantum era is like AES-128 before

* 128-bits or less symmetric ciphers are quantum-attackable

Conclusion: 256-bit symmetric ciphers are generally quantum safe

* AES-256, ChaCha20-256, Twofish-256, Camellia-256 are considered quantum-safe
