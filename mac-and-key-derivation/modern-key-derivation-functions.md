# Modern Key Derivation Functions

**PBKDF2** has a major weakness: it is **not GPU-resistant** and **not ASIC-resistant**, because it uses relatively small amount of RAM and can be efficiently implemented on GPU \(graphics cards\) or **ASIC** \(specialized hardware\).

Modern key-derivation functions \(KDF\) like [**Scrypt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) and [**Argon2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) are designed to be **resistant** to **dictionary attacks**, **GPU attacks** and **ASIC attacks**. These functions derive a key \(of fixed length\) from a password \(text\) and need a lot memory \(RAM\), which does not allow fast parallel computations on GPU or ASIC hardware.

Algorithms like **Bcrypt**, **Scrypt** and **Argon2** are considered more **secure** KDF functions. They use **salt** + many **iterations** + a lot of **CPU** + a lot of **RAM** memory and this makes very hard to design a custom hardware to significantly speed up password cracking.

It takes a lot of **CPU time** to derive the key \(e.g. 0.2 sec\) + a lot of **RAM memory** \(e.g. 1GB\). The calculation process is memory-dependent, so **the memory access is the bottleneck** of the calculations. Faster RAM access will speed-up the calculations.

When a lot of CPU and RAM is used to derive the key from given password, **cracking passwords is slow** and inefficient \(e.g. 5-10 attempts / second\), even when using very good password cracking hardware and software. The goal of the modern KDF functions is to make practically infeasible to perform a brute-force attack to reverse the password from its hash.

Let's discuss in more details **Scrypt**, **Bcrypt** and **Argon2**.
